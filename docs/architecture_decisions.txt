LocationEvent service process user coordinates sent by mobiles devices. This communication is established using gRPC.
This decision is based in the fact of efficiency and the requirements about lot of users sending data concurrently.
It could be a RESTFul API once this service only sends data directly to Kafka and no high loading processing is done.

Behind the LocationEvent has a Kafka cluster that receives this location data that will be consumed by LocationProcessor microservice
and this data will be stored in postgres database.

Location service is the service that iteracts through a RESTFul API with the React Frontend.
Person Microservice is other RESTFul API service responsible to keep user information.
Location Microservice gets data from Person microservice when a request to find out possible coonnection is made.
It is done by RESTFul API, however, It could be a cache in front of the service to retrieve quickly user information
